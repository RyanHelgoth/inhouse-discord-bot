# What is Inhouse Discord Bot?
- Inhouse Discord Bot is a Discord bot that randomizes teams and puts users in the correct voice channels. Simplifies setting up inhouse/scrim games with friends.

# How can I add the bot to my server?
- Currently the bot is under development, but after it is done a link will be posted here to add the bot to your server.

# How do you use the bot?
- Once the bot is completed, commands and their uses will be listed here.

# How can I run the code on my computer?
- The code for this bot is available to download and modify, however the code will not run without a token. This token is private and I cannot share it for security reasons. 
- To get your own token you will have to create a bot through the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Then you can put the line token = "/<YOUR TOKEN HERE/>" into a file named config.py in the same folder as main.py and the code should now work for you. 

# Who worked on Inhouse Discord Bot?
- All the Python code is written by Ryan Helgoth
